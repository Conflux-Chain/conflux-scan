              These Terms do not apply to the Conflux open source client software or the Conflux distributed open source global network

              determine each time in its sole discretion. Using a particular form of notice in some instances does not obligate us to use
              the same form in other instances. Any changes or modifications will be effective immediately upon posting the revisions to the
              Site and will apply to your subsequent use of the Site. You waive any right you may have to receive specific notice of such

              code. However, Conflux does not own or control Conflux Protocol. Conflux Protocol is an open-source protocol that anyone can
              use, copy, modify and distribute. We encourage you to take precautions when considering whether to use Conflux Protocol,

              Conflux: (i) does not own or control Conflux Protocol; (ii) does not have any authority or responsibility to prohibit,
              restrict, rescind or approve any transaction or other interaction that occurs through Conflux Protocol; (iii) is not a party

              with respect to any communications, transactions, interactions, disputes or any relations whatsoever between you and any other
              participant, person or organization that uses Conflux Protocol; and (iv) does not investigate or verify the reputation,
              conduct, morality or criminal background of any Conflux Protocol user, including without limitation any Conflux gateway.
              Further, you acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for your access and use of Conflux Protocol, including
              without limitation for: (i) any payments or other transactions you complete using Conflux Protocol; (ii) investigating or
              screening other Conflux Protocol users before engaging in any Conflux transaction with such users; (iii) any interactions you
              have with other Conflux Protocol users or gateways; and (iv) your use of any Conflux gateways to exchange any currency or
              other items of value that you may have stored in your Conflux wallet. CONFLUX ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY CONSEQUENCES
              RELATING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY TO ANY ACTION OR INACTION YOU TAKE IN CONNECTION WITH CONFLUX PROTOCOL. YOU ASSUME ALL RISKS

              <br />
              c. User Content that may impinge upon the publicity, privacy or data protection rights of others, including pictures or

              liability of any type.
            </p>
            <p>
              Conflux does not control, take responsibility for or assume liability for any User Content posted, stored or uploaded by you
              or any third party, or for any loss or damage thereto, nor is Conflux liable for any user conduct or any mistakes, defamation,

              If you become aware of User Content that you believe violates these Terms, you may report it by emailing
              terms@conflux-chain.org. Enforcement of the Terms, however, is solely in our discretion and the absence of enforcement of
              these Terms in some instances does not constitute a waiver of our right to enforce the Terms in other instances. In addition,
              these Terms do not create any private right of action on the part of any third party or any reasonable expectation or promise
              that the Site will not contain any content that is prohibited by the Terms. Although Conflux has no obligation to screen, edit
              or monitor any of the User Content posted on the Site, Conflux reserves the right, and has absolute discretion, to remove,
              screen or edit any User Content posted or stored on the Site at any time and for any reason without notice, and you are solely
              responsible for creating backup copies and replacing any User Content you post or store on the Site at your sole cost and
              expense. Any use of the Site in violation of these Terms may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your
              rights to use the Interactive Areas and/or the Site.
            </p>
            <p>
              Except as otherwise provided herein, on the Site or in a separate agreement, Conflux claims no ownership or control over any
              User Content. However, if you post User Content to the Site, you grant Conflux a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual,

              distribute, perform and display such User Content on our websites and on third-party sites. This license will terminate when
              you remove your User Content, except that the license will continue with respect to any offsite uses that have already been
              made and any cached or archived uses that may still exist when User Content is removed. By posting User Content, you hereby
              release Conflux and its agents and employees from any claims that such use, as authorized above, violates any of your rights
              and you understand that you will not be entitled to any additional compensation for any use of your User Content.

              Conflux reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Site or any features or portions thereof

            <h3>17. ARBITRATION</h3>
            <p>
              PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH CONFLUX AND IT LIMITS THE
              MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF. You and Conflux agree to arbitrate any dispute arising from these Terms or relating to
              the Site, except that you and Conflux are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable or other
              relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents. ARBITRATION
              PREVENTS YOU FROM SUING IN COURT OR FROM HAVING A JURY TRIAL. You and Conflux agree that you will notify each other of any
              dispute within thirty (30) days of when it arises, that you will attempt informal resolution prior to any demand for
              arbitration. In any arbitration, the parties will not seek discovery from each other, and the arbitrator shall not allow
              parties to engage in discovery; rather, each party shall disclose the evidence supporting their positions at some mutually
              agreeable time and date prior to the final hearing. Other than className procedures and remedies discussed below, the
              arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court. Neither you nor we will
              participate in a className action or className-wide arbitration for any claims covered by these Terms. You also agree not to
              participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving
              another person, if Conflux is a party to the proceeding. If the prohibition against className actions and other claims brought
              on behalf of third parties contained above are found to be unenforceable, then that language shall be deemed to have been
              dropped from the Terms and the remaining obligations relating to arbitration shall continue in full force and effect.
